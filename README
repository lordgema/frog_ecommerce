WARNING - This hasn't been tested. I plan on creating an install script to do all of this automatically.

 Install
----------------------------------------

* The front-end relies on Prototype. I plan on converting it to jQuery. There really isn't that much going on with it.
* You will need the FCKEditor plugin for product descriptions create and update pages to work correctly.
* I'm also using CKFinder, a file manager pugin for FCK to upload and choose product files and videos.

Create the following pages in Frog. You will use the id's of these pages for the changes in the EcommerceController.php below.

The plugin expects the parent item to be called Products with a slug of 'products'. You'll need to change the references in the controller if you want it to be called something different.

Products
----Types
----Vendors
----Cart
----Checkout

----------------------------------------
 Layout
----------------------------------------

There are layout tokens for the main cart front-end, cart actions and cart flash. Use the tokens below to pull in that content:

Main
<!-- ecommerce -->

Cart actions
<!-- ecommerce cart actions -->

Ecommerce flash
<!-- ecommerce flash -->
